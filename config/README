Configuration files for modules.

Create a directory for each module in this project (usually just one)
of the form 'alfresco.module.[module name]' and place configuration
information in that directory.

This will ensure that your configuration files end up in the right place 
on the classpath and do not clash with those of other modules when the 
AMP is applied to your target WAR.

Look in each directory here for further information on the structure of the config directory.
