This is the module config directory

It should contain:

module.properties:			Metadata on this module.  Read the inline comments
							therein for more information.

file-mapping.properties: 	Defines the mapping between AMP and WAR. There 
							should be no need to change the file provided

module-context.xml:			Spring configuration for this module.

bootstrap-context.xml:		If required, bootstrap context for this module.
							If present, it will be included by module-context.xml.
							You might use the bootstrap to load a custom model,
							to load a custom web client config, or for other reasons

web-client-custom.xml:		If required, custom web client configuration.  If present,
							it will be bootstrapped into the web client by 
							bootsrap-context.xml.

log4j.properties:			Logging configuration for this module


Configuration, for module components should be placed in a subdirectory of this 
directory corresponding to the package name of the class being configured.  These
files may then be included by module-context.xml (for Spring configuration).  Custom
models should be placed in a "model" subdirectory of the appropriate component package.
All spring configuration files should end -context.xml.
