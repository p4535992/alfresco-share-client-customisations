# Use this file to define where in the target WAR various directories in the amp will be placed
#
# There's a default set of mappings which are used if no file-mapping.properties file is present
# and these are included below.  It's good practice to go as close to the default mappings as is 
# possible - you can always change the file structure in the build.xml rather than using a surprising
# mapping here

# Include the default mappings
include.default=true

# There's no default mapping that allows for webscripts to go in a sensible place in the amp and the
# share.war
