	<!--
		This file defines Spring configuration for the module. Small modules
		can include their configuration directly, but as module size increases
		it becomes a better idea to split the spring config up using imports
		as shown below. This allows you to assemble a module from pluggable
		components more easily. The path in the config should relate to the
		package name of the component(s) you are configuring for ease of
		navigation.
